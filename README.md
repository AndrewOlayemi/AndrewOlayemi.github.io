**Title:** [DREWS ECOMMERCE SALES REPORT](https://github.com/AndrewOlayemi/AndrewOlayemi.github.io/blob/main/Excel1.JPG)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel

**Project Description:** This project analyzed bicycle product sales data to identify trends and performance patterns between 2013 and 2014. The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that provides a clear overview of key performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to monitor sales across regions, products, and time periods.

The dashboard covers sales activity in Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and the United States, offering insights into regional variations and growth opportunities.

The companyâ€™s bicycle product portfolio includes Carretera, Paseo, Velo, VTT, and Amarilla. The analysis highlights product-level performance, seasonal demand shifts, and year-over-year growth, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify best-selling products, track underperformers, and evaluate market potential across different countries.

Dashboard Features:

Sales Sum by Product/Date: Displays total sales for each year and each product, showing which product generated the highest revenue.

Profit Sum by Product/Date: Visualizes total profit for each year and product.

Country and Segment by Sales Sum: Breaks down sales performance by country and segment, highlighting which products sold the most within each segment.

Country and Segment by Profit Sum: Similar to the above, but focused on profit.

Country by Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Identifies which countries incurred the highest COGS.


**Key findings:**
1. Sales Sum by Product/Date: Paseo generated the highest sales in 2014.

2. Profit Sum by Product/Date: Paseo was also the most profitable product. The data revealed which products require improvement.

3. Country and Segment by Sales Sum: Sales increased in 2014 across multiple countries, with government purchases contributing the most to overall growth.

4. Country and Segment by Profit Sum: France achieved the highest profit in 2014.

5. Country by COGS: The lowest COGS occurred in the third quarter of each year, corresponding with the lowest sales and profits in 2014.
