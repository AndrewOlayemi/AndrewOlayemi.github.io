# Data Analytics Portfolio
# Project 1

**Title:** [DREWS ECOMMERCE SALES REPORT](https://github.com/AndrewOlayemi/AndrewOlayemi.github.io/blob/main/Excel1.JPG)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel

**Project Description:** This project analyzed bicycle product sales data to identify trends and performance patterns between 2013 and 2014. The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that provides a clear overview of key performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to monitor sales across regions, products, and time periods.

The dashboard covers sales activity in Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and the United States, offering insights into regional variations and growth opportunities.

The company’s bicycle product portfolio includes Carretera, Paseo, Velo, VTT, and Amarilla. The analysis highlights product-level performance, seasonal demand shifts, and year-over-year growth, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify best-selling products, track underperformers, and evaluate market potential across different countries.


Dashboard Features:

Sales Sum by Product/Date: Displays total sales for each year and each product, showing which product generated the highest revenue.

Profit Sum by Product/Date: Visualizes total profit for each year and product.

Country and Segment by Sales Sum: Breaks down sales performance by country and segment, highlighting which products sold the most within each segment.

Country and Segment by Profit Sum: Similar to the above, but focused on profit.

Country by Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Identifies which countries incurred the highest COGS.


**Key findings:**
1. Sales Sum by Product/Date: Paseo generated the highest sales in 2014.

2. Profit Sum by Product/Date: Paseo was also the most profitable product. The data revealed which products require improvement.

3. Country and Segment by Sales Sum: Sales increased in 2014 across multiple countries, with government purchases contributing the most to overall growth.

4. Country and Segment by Profit Sum: France achieved the highest profit in 2014.

5. Country by COGS: The lowest COGS occurred in the third quarter of each year, corresponding with the lowest sales and profits in 2014.

# Project 2

**Title:** [EU SUPERSTORE REPORT](https://github.com/AndrewOlayemi/AndrewOlayemi.github.io/blob/main/EU%20Superstore.JPG)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel

**Project Description:**
This project analyzed sales and profit data from an e-commerce business that began operations in Manchester, United Kingdom. Initially, the company sold products across three categories: Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture. Products were purchased, rebranded, and resold to consumers.

As the business expanded, it grew into multiple countries and hired three sales managers. Their performance across different countries and regions was analyzed under the following metrics:

Dashboard Features:

Country/Region by Sum of Profit: Total profit earned from each category in each country and region.

Category/Country vs. Sum of Sales: Total sales by category across countries.

Order Date vs. Total Sales: Trends in total sales each year by quarter.

Order Date vs. Sum of Profit: Trends in quarterly profit across years.

Profit by Category/Sales Managers: Performance of sales managers in generating profit each year.

Profit vs. Region: Profit earned by category across different regions.

Category vs. Sales: Categories generating the highest sales.

Category vs. Profit: Categories generating the highest profit.


**Key findings:**
1. Category vs. Profit & Category vs. Sales: Technology generated the highest sales, but Office Supplies yielded the highest profit.

2. Sales Volatility (Order Date vs. Sales & Profit): Quarterly analysis revealed fluctuations in both sales and profit. The first quarter of each year consistently showed lower performance across all categories.

3. Country/Region vs. Profit & Sales: Certain countries and regions demonstrated stronger performance, indicating where categories generated the most sales and profit.

![SQL.JPG](SQL.JPG)


**SQL Skills Used:**

Data Retrieval & Sources (SELECT, FROM, Aliasing AS)

Filtering & Conditions (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN, AND, IS NOT NULL)

String & Text Functions (UPPER, LEFT, SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, + for concatenation, LIKE)

Aggregation & Grouping (COUNT, GROUP BY)

Sorting & Limiting (ORDER BY ASC/DESC, TOP)

Date & Time Functions (GETDATE)

Table Operations (SELECT INTO)



**Project Description:**

This project involved practicing a wide range of SQL queries on employee data to strengthen data manipulation and analysis skills. The tasks covered core concepts such as data retrieval, filtering, string operations, aggregations, grouping, sorting, and table creation. Using SQL Server, I explored real-world scenarios like extracting employee details, counting department staff, working with dates, handling text fields, and generating new tables. The project demonstrates proficiency in applying SQL to clean, transform, and analyze structured datasets for reporting and decision-making.


**Technology used:** SQL server



# Project 4

**Title:** [Uber Ride Analytics Dataset](https://github.com/AndrewOlayemi/AndrewOlayemi.github.io/blob/main/Power_BI_Uber.JPG)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Power BI

**Project Description:**
This Power BI dashboard, built using the Uber Ride Analytics dataset, explores key insights on ride cancellations, customer behavior, driver ratings, and payment methods. It highlights patterns such as reasons for cancellations, differences in cancellations by vehicle type, and how driver ratings vary across payment options.

**Key findings:**

1. Reasons for Cancellation (by Customer)

The majority of records show as “null”, meaning reasons were not provided or not recorded.

Among stated reasons, common issues include Wrong Address and Change of Plans, while operational issues like driver not moving towards pickup were less frequent.

2. Cancellations by Driver Ratings

A large proportion of cancellations are linked to drivers with blank or missing ratings (38%).

2. Driver Ratings by Payment Method

UPI (digital payments) has the highest share of driver ratings, suggesting it’s the most common or preferred payment method.

# Project 5

**Title:** [Drew E-Commerce Dashboard](https://github.com/AndrewOlayemi/AndrewOlayemi.github.io/blob/main/Power_BI_Dashboard_Drew_Eccommerce.JPG)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Power BI

**Project Description:** 
This Power BI project analyzes bicycle product sales (Carretera, Paseo, Velo, VTT, Amarilla) across Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and the United States between 2013–2014. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as sales, profit, COGS, and segment performance, enabling quick insights into regional trends, product demand, and year-over-year growth.


**Key findings:**
1. Sales by Segment

The Government segment is the largest contributor by far, followed by Channel Partners and Enterprise.

2. Sales Over Time

Sales followed a similar seasonal trend to profit, with recurring peaks at year-end (Q4).

This indicates stronger demand cycles toward the end of the year.

3. Profit Over Time

Profit shows noticeable fluctuations across 2013–2014, with peaks in late 2013 (Nov) and late 2014 (Dec).

Seasonal cycles appear to influence profitability.
