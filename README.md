# Project 1

**Title:** [DREWS ECOMMERCE SALES REPORT](https://github.com/AndrewOlayemi/AndrewOlayemi.github.io/blob/main/Excel1.JPG)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel

**Project Description:** This project analyzed bicycle product sales data to identify trends and performance patterns between 2013 and 2014. The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that provides a clear overview of key performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to monitor sales across regions, products, and time periods.

The dashboard covers sales activity in Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and the United States, offering insights into regional variations and growth opportunities.

The companyâ€™s bicycle product portfolio includes Carretera, Paseo, Velo, VTT, and Amarilla. The analysis highlights product-level performance, seasonal demand shifts, and year-over-year growth, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify best-selling products, track underperformers, and evaluate market potential across different countries.

Dashboard Features:

Sales Sum by Product/Date: Displays total sales for each year and each product, showing which product generated the highest revenue.

Profit Sum by Product/Date: Visualizes total profit for each year and product.

Country and Segment by Sales Sum: Breaks down sales performance by country and segment, highlighting which products sold the most within each segment.

Country and Segment by Profit Sum: Similar to the above, but focused on profit.

Country by Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Identifies which countries incurred the highest COGS.


**Key findings:**
1. Sales Sum by Product/Date: Paseo generated the highest sales in 2014.

2. Profit Sum by Product/Date: Paseo was also the most profitable product. The data revealed which products require improvement.

3. Country and Segment by Sales Sum: Sales increased in 2014 across multiple countries, with government purchases contributing the most to overall growth.

4. Country and Segment by Profit Sum: France achieved the highest profit in 2014.

5. Country by COGS: The lowest COGS occurred in the third quarter of each year, corresponding with the lowest sales and profits in 2014.

# Project 2

**Title:** [EU SUPERSTORE REPORT](https://github.com/AndrewOlayemi/AndrewOlayemi.github.io/blob/main/EU%20Superstore.JPG)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel

**Project Description:**
This project analyzed sales and profit data from an e-commerce business that began operations in Manchester, United Kingdom. Initially, the company sold products across three categories: Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture. Products were purchased, rebranded, and resold to consumers.

As the business expanded, it grew into multiple countries and hired three sales managers. Their performance across different countries and regions was analyzed under the following metrics:

Dashboard Features:

Country/Region by Sum of Profit: Total profit earned from each category in each country and region.

Category/Country vs. Sum of Sales: Total sales by category across countries.

Order Date vs. Total Sales: Trends in total sales each year by quarter.

Order Date vs. Sum of Profit: Trends in quarterly profit across years.

Profit by Category/Sales Managers: Performance of sales managers in generating profit each year.

Profit vs. Region: Profit earned by category across different regions.

Category vs. Sales: Categories generating the highest sales.

Category vs. Profit: Categories generating the highest profit.


**Key findings:**
1. Category vs. Profit & Category vs. Sales: Technology generated the highest sales, but Office Supplies yielded the highest profit.

2. Sales Volatility (Order Date vs. Sales & Profit): Quarterly analysis revealed fluctuations in both sales and profit. The first quarter of each year consistently showed lower performance across all categories.

3. Country/Region vs. Profit & Sales: Certain countries and regions demonstrated stronger performance, indicating where categories generated the most sales and profit.
